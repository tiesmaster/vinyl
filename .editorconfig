# .NET SDK diagnostics (roslyn-analyzers)

# CA1062: Validate arguments of public methods
# Justification: Use C# 8 nullable reference types instead.

# Justification: We're not in 2001 anymore.

# StyleCop diagnostics

# SA1101: Prefix local calls with this
# Justification: Superfluous, so let's not do this.
dotnet_diagnostic.SA1101.severity = none

# SA1200: Using directives should be placed correctly
# Justification: Defacto standard these days is to put them on top.
dotnet_diagnostic.SA1200.severity = none

# SA1204: Static elements should appear before instance elements
# Justification: Private static methods can be helpers in the given class, and following the rule of
# "be able to read like a book", static methods shouldn't be placed higher then when they're referenced.

# SA1309: Field names should not begin with underscore
# Justification: The naming convention of this project is to start a field with an underscore.

# SA1512: Single-line comments should not be followed by blank line
# Justification: Blank line after "multiple" single-line comments is more neat.

# SA1600: Elements should be documented
# Justification: Not every single public member requires documentation.
